# IM9906-2-IdentityHashMapSpecTester

# Purpose
This project is related to the IM9906-2-VerifyingIdentityHashMap project (see: 
https://github.com/m4ndeb2r/IM9906-2-VerifyingIdentityHashMap). The purpose of that 
project is to formally analyse the OpenJDK's [`IdentityHashMap`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u/jdk/file/4dd5e486620d/src/share/classes/java/util/IdentityHashMap.java).

The purpose of this project is to provide unittests to check the JML specs in the 
IM9906-2-VerifyingIdentityHashMap project. This way, for example, defining class invariants 
is made easier because it is possible to check the invariants by running some basic tests.
